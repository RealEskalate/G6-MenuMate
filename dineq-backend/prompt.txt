Global rules:

Use provided IDs if given, else generate UUID-like IDs.

createdAt, updatedAt, publishedAt = current ISO8601.

updatedBy = "system". version=1. isPublished=false unless clearly marked.

isDeleted=false, viewCount=0 by default.

Parsing rules:

Tabs = classify items into(Food, Drinks, Desserts etc).

Categories = Categories = classify items under each tab (Breakfast, Lunch, Supper, Appetizers, Traditional food etc.) based on OCR text.

Items = extract names and trailing numeric prices. Multiple prices = separate items with size in name.

Ignore ads or headers without items.

Enrichment rules:

Descriptions: factual, no health claims.

Allergies: infer only if certain.

Calories: estimate realistically.

Prep time: estimate by cuisine.

Translation rules (Amharic fields):

Prioritize Natural Phrasing & Cultural Equivalence: Translate for meaning and emotion rather than literal word-for-word rendering. Use idiomatic Amharic that feels natural to native speakers. For example, instead of translating "hold in your hand" literally, use "በእጅዎ ይዘውት" to align with common usage.
Maintain Food Context & Cultural Relevance: Ensure translations reflect the Ethiopian dining experience, using vocabulary specific to food preparation, serving, and enjoyment. For example, translate "eating a bite" as "አንድ ጉርሻ መብላት" to evoke the act of savoring food in a culturally appropriate way.
Use Standard Amharic Food Terminology: Employ accurate, widely recognized Amharic terms for ingredients, dishes, and beverages. Avoid unfamiliar or direct translations. For instance, use "ለስላሳ መጠጥ" for "soda" instead of a literal term like "የካርቦን መጠጥ."
Capture the Tone of the Description: Convey a warm, inviting tone that reflects the sensory experience of the food. Use descriptive adjectives and verbs to evoke taste, texture, and enjoyment, avoiding mechanical or overly formal language. For example, translate "delicious meal" as "ጣፋጭና መንፈስን የሚያድስ ምግብ" to maintain warmth.
Paraphrase Untranslatable Concepts Clearly: For English phrases or concepts without direct Amharic equivalents, rephrase concisely to convey the intended meaning. For example, translate "a comforting and satisfying meal" as "መንፈስን የሚያረጋጋና የሚያረካ ምግብ" to preserve the emotional impact.
Translate in Complete, Grammatically Correct Sentences: Always produce full, natural-sounding sentences in Amharic. Avoid fragments or isolated phrases, as they can result in awkward or unclear text. For example, instead of translating "tasty dish" as "ጣፋጭ ምግብ," use a complete sentence like "ይህ ምግብ እጅግ በጣም ጣፋጭ ነው።"

Quality rules:

Do not hallucinate prices, set 0 if unclear.

No duplicate items. Keep lowest nonzero price if repeated.

Sort tabs Food, Drinks, Desserts. Categories follow OCR order.

Output must be valid JSON starting with { and ending with }.
